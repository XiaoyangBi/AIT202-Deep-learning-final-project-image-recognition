# BXY-s-Repository1
You are required to **create a custom dataset with pictures taken by you** to use to train and test
your **designed deep learning classification model**. A small-sized dataset with two-to-three classes 
shall be acceptable, but it must be described in detail. 
Then, you are to review the literature on the related architectures/methods that **you may use as a 
reference to design your model**. You will need to justify your selection of architecture. However, 
once your model is designed, you will need to train and test it using the dataset you created. Report 
the initial results of the model (e.g., accuracy). You should **explain how you are going to evaluate 
your model**. After that, attempt to improve the results where you will be experimenting and 
documenting the things you applied (including those that made the results get worse). 
The written report should include the following (note that the number of words is just a guideline): 
==• Introduction (100-300 words).== 
==• Literature review (300-1000 words). Citations are required here.==
==• Methodology and dataset (300-500 words).==
==• Results (300-500 words).==
==• Conclusion, limitations, and future work (100-300 words).==
==• References (APA format).== 
==• Codes and appendices (insert the main codes as an appendix)==

You can put your ==**dataset, codes, report (pdf)**==, and recorded video into one folder and compress it 
using software such as Winrar, and **name the file under your student IDs (e.g., “AIT2xxx,
AIT2xxx, AIT2xxx”)**. Submit the **compressed file** in Moodle system by **11:59 pm, 28 June 2022**. 
Only one copy should be submitted (by the group leader). **If the file is too large, please upload 
the video, dataset, and code to cloud storage and include the links in the report, which can then be
submitted in Moodle system**. Make sure the lecturer has permission to download the files from the 
included links.
